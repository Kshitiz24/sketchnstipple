Painting for me is a medium to appeal human senses and emotions as I believe that Paintings can be used to reflect feelings, culture, situations and thoughts. I find lot of interest in understanding relationships between forms and colours. 
•Creating a piece of visual art provides me with inner peace and satisfaction
•I want to enhance my skills to cover all forms of visual arts and convey realties of this world to people through my paintings
