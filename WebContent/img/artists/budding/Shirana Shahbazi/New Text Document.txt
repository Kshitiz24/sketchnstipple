Shirana Shahbazi uses the tropes of traditional photography as a springboard for her bold multimedia practice. Shahbazi teases out the formal and conceptual possibilities of portrait, still life, and landscape photography by gathering the different genres together and translating images into different mediums, including large-scale installations. A favorite photograph might start as a traditional c-print and then be transformed into a massive painted mural or a complex rug. In crisp, vibrant images of mountains, human bodies, and abstract geometric shapes, Shahbazi honors the infinite facets of form, color, and photography.
